This Project was created for CVWO Winter Assignment 2024 by Nikhil Sultania.
use go run main.go to run the app;
it executes very basic CRUD operations and creating accounts,threads

to verify if go app runs use curl like so
curl http://localhost:8080/createPost \ 
--include \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request "POST" \
--data '{"Owner":"Owner-Name","Title":"Post-Title","Description" : "Description"}'

For SQL I used a mySQL server running locally with a database called datas with a table called threads, which I could not upload or deploy due to time constraints
